## Calamity Map
An app that shows a map of places with people who are trapped/unsafe, safe and aid camps around you in calamities like an Earthquake or a Flood.

## How It Works?
During a calamity user marks himself as safe or unsafe and gets a small form which asks him/her about number of people with him and his needs at that point of time like food or medical aids. Using this we build a map of **Safe users** (green circles), **Unsafe users** (red pins) and **Aid camps** (yellow pins) and show all this map data to every person using app in affected area. Safe users have options of going to aid camp locations nearest to them or they can help out with the unsafe people if possible or they can choose the option to stay and wait for rescue teams. Unsafe people will be marked with higher priority among the rescue teams and they have option to fill a very small form asking about problems like injuries and food shortage. Rescue teams can get all the information and needs about the people stuck by clicking on people shown on the map which can further help them in optimising supplies and time taken in rescue operations.
